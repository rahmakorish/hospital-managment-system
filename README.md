Clinic Appointment Booking System

Welcome to my Clinic Appointment Booking System â€“ a robust and efficient solution designed to streamline the appointment booking process in clinics. This project showcases the proficiency of our developers in leveraging C++ and the Queue data structure to create a user-friendly and effective system.
Key Features:
1. Efficient Queue Implementation:

this project utilizes C++ Queue to implement a robust appointment booking system. The Queue data structure, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, ensures that the first patient to book an appointment is the first to be served. This design aligns seamlessly with the chronological nature of appointment scheduling.
2. Patient Information Handling:

The system is designed to efficiently handle patient information. It creates a patient structure, allowing for the seamless organization and storage of relevant details. With dedicated methods, users can effortlessly create, display, and admit patients, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
3. Inquiry Mechanism:

Our system goes beyond basic functionality by providing an inquiry mechanism. Users can inquire about specific values, checking whether a particular piece of information is present in the queue or not. This feature enhances the overall flexibility and adaptability of the appointment booking process.
Benefits to Users:

    User-Friendly Interface:
    The project offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, making it accessible to both clinic staff and patients.

    Efficient Appointment Management:
    By adhering to the FIFO principle, the system optimizes appointment management, ensuring fairness and timely service for all patients.

    Structured Patient Information:
    With the patient struct implementation, the system ensures organized storage and retrieval of patient information, contributing to a smoother clinic workflow.

    Quick Inquiry Responses:
    The inquiry mechanism allows for swift checks on specific information, facilitating efficient decision-making for clinic staff.
